a.Functional Description-This java code is a method that takes an integer k and integer array called “list”. It then initializes an integer variable called “average” with zero. There is then an integer variable “n” that is chosen by selecting the smaller number between “k” and “list.length” using the “Math.min” function. There is then an if statement that checks if the “n” is bigger than than zero and then continues with a “for” loop. The for loop will then iterate through the “n” number of elements in the list and adding it to the variable “average” and then dividing it by  “n”  to get the average and storing it into the variable “average”. Finally, “average” is returned.
